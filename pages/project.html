        This project was completed by me alongside three other people during
        our Fundamentals of Engineering Design Innovation class. Our initial
        goal was to create some sort of system that would help improve the
        social and academic experience of the students at CU Denver.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
        After taking some time to consider our own ideas and perform interviews
        with potential users, we determined that a website would be a useful
        medium to attempt to solve our problem. We created a simple prototype
        using pencil and paper and did some testing.

          <div class="caption">A compilation of our initial ideation, prototyping, and user testing</div>
        </div>
        <p>
        After a process of refining our ideas and concepts, we made two realizations:
        <ol>
          <li>We should focus on specifically academic communication and resource access.</li>
          <li>There is no reason to limit this only to students at CU Denver.</li>
        </ol>
        With that, we settled on designing a website that provided an open
        forum for asking and answering academic questions, and made it easy for
        students to share and find academic resources. We produced several
        higher-fidelity prototypes and did some more user testing.
